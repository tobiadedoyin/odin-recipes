    <h4>Description</h4>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
      <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water.
        Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are
        softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and
        black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and
        blend until marinade is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level
        surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a
        1/2-inch thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken
        several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at
        least 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no
        longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
